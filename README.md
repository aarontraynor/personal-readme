## A Brief Introduction...

Hey - Aaron here! :wave: I've just finished my CompSci degree at [KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk) and can't wait to get started with my career as a developer.

While I've been at uni, I've been working part-time in IT support for a healthcare & life sciences [venture capital firm](https://svhealthinvestors.com/) (they're doing some really cool stuff - [check it out](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2019-07-02-cancer-research-uk-forms-collaboration-with-sv-health-investors-to-accelerate-development-of-cancer)!). I've had a blast and worked with some amazing people, but it's time for me to move into something more exciting and challenging.

I'm just getting started with development in an industry setting and I can't wait to start putting my skills into practice, but please do be patient with me if I ask questions that you might think are straightforward - I'm still new to all this! :baby:

As for me as a person - I'm pretty shy at first, but give me some time and I'll come out of my shell!
