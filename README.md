# Aaron Traynor

## A Brief Introduction

Hey - Aaron here! :wave: I've just finished my CompSci degree at [KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk) and can't wait to get started with my career as a developer.

### Where did I work before?

While I've been at uni, I've been working part-time in IT support for a Healthcare & Life Sciences [Venture Capital firm](https://svhealthinvestors.com/) (they're doing some really cool stuff - [check it out](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2019-07-02-cancer-research-uk-forms-collaboration-with-sv-health-investors-to-accelerate-development-of-cancer)!). I've had a blast and worked with some amazing people, but it's time for me to move into something more exciting and challenging.

### A bit more about me

I'm just getting started with development in an industry setting and I can't wait to start putting my skills into practice, but please do be patient with me if I ask questions that you might think are straightforward - I'm still new to all this! :baby:

### How I work

I'm very much a "learn by doing" kind of person. While books and guides are full of plenty of great information, I'll get my head around something a lot quicker by getting stuck in.

Please always feel free to speak with me about anything - I'm always happy to have a chat. It's super important to me that everyone I'm working with is happy, so if there's anything I can do to help, never be afraid to ask! :relaxed:

I will always reply to Slack messages as quickly as I can - it's the best way to reach me if I'm not available right away.

Part of my previous role involved researching and implementing new tools to improve productivity across the company. 2 years of doing that has made me very open to adopting new tools and ideas that improve both my own workflow and the workflow of our team. If you have any suggestions, I'm always happy to give it a try!

### What about outside of work?

Outside of work, I really love photography (shameless plug to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/atraynor97/) if you're interested). I *love* to get creative with lighting at night (light trails are one of my favourite things to shoot :grin:), or capture the beautiful architecture and stunning landscapes of the places I travel to. Here's a few of my most favourite shots!

Aside from that, I also love to play the Ukulele! One of my favourite things to do is to head down to [Ukulele Wednesdays](https://ukulelewednesdays.com/) for a jam with friends - it's a fantastic mid-week stress reliever and a great laugh! I started playing at the beginning of uni and never looked back.
